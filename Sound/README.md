These Amiga sound files were created/recreated using these files:
https://unbox.ifarchive.org/?url=/if-archive/infocom/media/sound/lhsound.zip

For each file:
- made notes concerning the header data
- used HxD to remove the header
- imported RAW 8-bit unsigned data to Audacity, using the sample rate from the header data
- exported that as RAW 8-bit signed data
- used HxD to add the header, saving as **.dat**
