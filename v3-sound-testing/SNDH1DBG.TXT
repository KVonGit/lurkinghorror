You've waited until the last minute again. This time it's the end of the term,
so all the TechNet terminals in the dorm are occupied. So, off you go to the old
Comp Center. Too bad it's the worst storm of the winter (Murphy's Law, right?),
and you practically froze to death slogging over here from the dorm. Not to
mention jumping at every shadow, what with all the recent disappearances. Time
to find a free machine, get to work, and write that twenty page paper.

Terminal Room
This is a large room crammed with computer terminals, small computers, and
printers. An exit leads south. Banners, posters, and signs festoon the walls.
Most of the tables are covered with waste paper, old pizza boxes, and empty Coke
cans. There are usually a lot of people here, but tonight it's almost deserted.

A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

Nearby is one of those ugly molded plastic chairs.

Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.

>TURN ON PC
The computer powers up, goes through a remarkably fast self-check, and greets
you, requesting "LOGIN PLEASE:". The only sound you hear is a very low hum.

>LOGIN 872325412
The computer responds "PASSWORD PLEASE:"

>PASSWORD UHLERSOTH
The computer responds "Good evening. You're here awfully late." It displays a
list of pending tasks, one of which is in blinking red letters, with large
arrows pointing to it. The task reads "Classics Paper," some particularly
ominous words next to it say "DUE TOMORROW!" and more reassuringly, a menu box
next to that reads "Edit Classics Paper."

>CLICK EDIT
The menu box is replaced by the YAK text editor and menu boxes listing the
titles of your files. The one for your paper is highlighted in a rather urgent-
looking shade of red.

>CLICK YAK
You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills
most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance
to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something
different, very different.

>X PAPER
The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The
text is mostly in a sort of "Olde English" you've never seen before. What you
read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords,
debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in
English.

As you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but
impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the "MORE" box...

>CLICK MORE
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

The second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look
at it straight, it's almost readable. There is something about a "summoning," or
a "visitor."

>G
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

The third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem.
There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.

There is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:

"He returns, he is called back (?)
The loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice
Those who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?)
They will live, yet die
Forever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)

"His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared
His food (offerings?) must be prepared
Call him forth (invite him?) with great power
Only an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth
He will be grateful (satiated?)"

The rest is even more fragmentary.

>G
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

The fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot.
Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what
is in it?

>G
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.

You faint, and when you awaken...

Place
This is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds
split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color,
everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a
shallow bowl of black basalt.

At Platform
You stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks

the crowd around you.

One small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a
blazing light.

Suddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with
excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins,
building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you
compacts and deepens.

>X IT
It's a smooth, shiny piece of what might be obsidian. Scratched on it is a
symbol.

The darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now-
silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its
palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel
the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.

>THROW STONE AT CREATURE
You can't. You go through the motions, but the stone doesn't leave your hand.

The thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly
for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its
mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and
the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.

You are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you.
Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you
glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard
the thump.

Terminal Room, on the chair

A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.

>ASK HIM ABOUT KEYS
"I've accumulated a few keys over the years. I'm a licensed locksmith, which
helps. I can get into any room at Tech." He pulls the keyring out on its chain,
and shows off a key you hadn't noticed before. "This is a master key," he says.

The hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant as he takes over your chair.
"Losing, huh?" he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a
pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.

>ASK HIM ABOUT MASTER
"That's one of my best keys. It's a Tech master key. Not that it really opens
every door at Tech, but I'd say three out of five, at least. Naturally, some
labs are off-limits even to this key."

The hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the
screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like
toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal
table (or the bottom of a trash can).

>ASK HIM FOR MASTER
"Fat chance! This is a master key! What have you done for me lately?"

The hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an
explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. "Chomping file system.
Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it." He checks the screen. "It
was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy."
He grunts. "People's names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called
'Lovecraft.'" He pauses. "Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could
help you down there."

>S
Second Floor
This is the second floor of the Computer Center. An elevator and call buttons
are on the south side of the hallway. A large, noisy room is to the north.
Stairs also lead up and down, for the energetic. To the west a corridor leads
into a smaller room.

>W
Kitchen
This is a filthy kitchen. The exit is to the east. On the wall near a counter
are a refrigerator and a microwave.

Sitting on the kitchen counter is a package of Funny Bones.

>OPEN FRIDGE
Opening the refrigerator reveals a cardboard carton and a two liter bottle of
Classic Coke.

>GET COKE AND CARTON

hacker.

A really whiz-bang pc is right inside the door.

>GIVE CARTON TO HACKER
"Ah! Serious food!" He plunges into the food with all the delicacy and table
manners of a shark at a feeding frenzy. Soon a satisfied expression appears on
his face. "Now, what was it you were wanting?" he asks.

>ASK HIM FOR MASTER
"Well, I suppose I could loan you the master key for a while. Just don't get
into trouble, okay? I'll find you later, when I'm done with all this, and get it
back." He hands you the key.

The elevator doors slide open.

>IN
Elevator
This is a battered, rather dirty elevator. The fake wood walls are scratched and
marred with graffiti. The elevator doors are open. To the right of the doors is
an area with floor buttons (B and 1 through 3), an open button, a close button,
a stop switch, and an alarm button. Below these is an access panel which is
closed.

>OPEN PANEL
Opening the access panel reveals a flashlight.

The elevator doors slide closed.

Smith Street.

>D
Basement
Bare concrete walls line a wide corridor leading east and west. An elevator and
call button are to the south. Stairs also lead up, for the energetic. From floor
to ceiling run wire channels and steam pipes.

>E
Temporary Basement
During the Second World War, some temporary buildings were built to house war-
related research. Naturally, these buildings, though flimsy and ugly, are still
around. This is the basement of one of them. The basement extends west, a
stairway leads up, and a large passage is to the east.

There is a crowbar and a pair of electrician's gloves here.

>GET GLOVES AND BAR
pair of electrician's gloves: Taken.
crowbar: Taken.

>WEAR GLOVES
You put on the gloves. They're a little big, but not really such a bad fit at
all.

>U
It is pitch black.

>LIGHT
(flashlight)
The flashlight clicks on.

Temporary Lab
This is a laboratory of some sort. It takes up most of the building on this
level, all the interior walls having been knocked down. (One reason these
temporary buildings are still here is their flexibility: no one cares if they
get more or less destroyed.) A stairway leads down, and a door leads north.

There is a metal flask here.

Aero Basement
This basement level room is made of smooth, damp-seeming concrete. Fluorescent
lights cast harsh shadows. To the west is a stairway, and to the east the
basement area continues.

There is a forklift here.

>W
Stairway
A dimly lit stairway leads up and down from here. A corridor continues east.

>U
Aero Lobby
This is the lobby of the Aeronautical Engineering Building. Stairs lead down and
a corridor heads south towards the main building.

>S
Infinite Corridor
The so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus
building. This is the west end. Side corridors lead north and south, and a set
of doors leads west into the howling blizzard.

There is a plastic container here.

There is a largish machine being operated down the hall to the east.

>GET CONTAIN
Taken.

>E
Infinite Corridor
The so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus
building. The corridor extends both ways from here. Many closed and locked
offices are to the north and south.

Infinite Corridor
The so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus
building. The corridor extends both ways from here. A stairway leads up, and a
door leads out to the Great Court.

A maintenance man is here, riding a floor waxer.

There is a wall socket on one wall, and a heavy-duty power cord is plugged into
it. The cord leads to a large floor waxer.

>U
Great Dome
Here a walkway circles the base of a huge ornate dome. Below is the Infinite
Corridor. From stories of Tech Exploring trips, you recall that there is
supposed to be a ladder here. On the other hand, there is a shiny rope-like
thing hanging near where the ladder used to be, and leading upward. Below you,
in the corridor, you can see a floor waxer, busily waxing the floor.

>CLIMB ROPE
The wet stuff on the strand sticks to the gloves, but doesn't otherwise affect
you. You have a little trouble climbing up to the catwalk, but grab the rail
just before your strength gives out. You heave yourself up onto the catwalk.

You stand up on the catwalk, catching your breath for a moment. Your eyes stray
along the strand you climbed. It trails along the catwalk, where it joins
something large and squishy squatting at the far side. A single, bright-blue eye
opens in the squishy mass, and the tentacle (for that's what it is) retracts.
The mass almost flows through the spaces in the catwalk railing and drops to the
floor fifteen feet below. Before you can react, it's gone.

Top of Dome
Inside the great dome, near the top, a metal catwalk is precariously perched.
There is no way further up, but a small metal door is set in the side of the
dome.

Where the pulpy mass was squatting, a wooden ladder lies on the catwalk.

>LOWER LADDER
You lower the ladder to the walkway below. It's just the right length to climb
down.

>OPEN DOOR
You open the door, and freezing air, blowing snow, and howling wind enter and
whip around you.

>OUT
You enter the freezing, biting cold of the blizzard.

Roof of Great Dome
You are perched precariously on the roof of the Great Dome. A set of narrow
indentations in the dome provides a dangerous route to the very tip-top of the
dome.

>U
You scramble up icy surface of the dome, almost slipping a few times, but
finally you make it to the top.

On the Great Dome
This is the very top of the Great Dome, a favorite place for Tech fraternities
to install cows, Volkswagen Beetles, giant birthday candles, and other bizarre
objects. The top is flat, round, and about five feet in diameter. It's very
windy, which has kept the snow from accumulating here. The only way off is down.

In the exact center of the flat area is a bronze plug.

Bitter, bone-cracking cold assaults you continuously. The temperature and the
blizzard conditions are both horrible.

>GET PLUG
You pry the plug out of its socket, revealing a cylindrical hole about the same
diameter but somewhat deeper. There is a piece of paper in the hole.

>DROP IT
Dropped.

>GET PAPER
Taken.

>D

You can feel the cold worming its way through your layers of clothing and biting
into your flesh.

There is a largish machine being operated down the hall to the east.

>CUT CORD WITH AXE
The axe crashes against the floor, and the power cord severs! The whine of the
floor waxer slows, and the maintenance man jerks to alertness.

>OPEN CONTAIN
You pull off the seal and open the container, revealing a smelly, viscous
liquid.

The maintenance man, growling foul-sounding imprecations, descends from the
floor waxer and heads towards you.

>EMPTY IT
It pours out and spreads like ants at a picnic. The floor is now covered from
wall to wall with slippery floor wax.

The maintenance man lurches toward you with surprising speed. He is nearly upon
you.

>DROP IT AND ASSIGN
plastic container: Dropped.
assignment: Dropped.

The maintenance man lurches toward you with surprising speed. Just as he is
about to grab you he slips on the wax. His hand whips by, inches from your
throat, and he drops to the floor, screaming in frustration.

>E
You slip and slide on the wax. It's like walking on wet ice. You can barely keep
upright, but it's worse for the maintenance man. His gait is so jerky that each
time he takes a step he falls! His persistence is impressive, but you slip
(literally) by before he can grab you.

Infinite Corridor

There is a formerly glass-fronted emergency cabinet here.

There is a largish machine down the hall to the east.

The maintenance man continues slipping, falling, standing, and so on. He reminds
you of a badly made windup toy.

>E
Infinite Corridor
The so-called infinite corridor runs from east to west in the main campus
building. This is the east end. The corridor branches north and south here.

A disabled floor waxer looms nearby.

The maintenance man continues slipping, falling, standing, and so on. He reminds
you of a badly made windup toy.

Fruits and Nuts
This is the central corridor of the Nutrition Building. The main building is
south, and a stairway leads down.

>D
Cluttered Passage
This cluttered passage leads southeast. It is full of apparently discarded
electronic equipment, old rusty file cabinets, and other detritus. A stairway
also leads up.

>SE
Brown Basement
This is a cluttered basement below the Brown Building. Discarded equipment
nearly blocks an already narrow hallway that terminates in a stairway leading
up. The passage itself continues northwest.

There is a pair of rubber boots here.

>GET BOOTS

>WEAR THEM
Snug, but okay.

>U
Brown Building
This is the lobby of the Brown Building, an eighteen-story skyscraper which
houses the Meteorology Department and other outposts of the Earth Sciences. The
elevator is out of order, but a long stairway leads up to the roof, and another
leads down to the basement. A revolving door leads out into the night.

>U
Top Floor
This is the top of the stairway. A door leads out to the roof here, and you can
hear the wind blowing beyond. There is a sign on the door.

>UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
The door is now unlocked.

>OPEN IT
You push the door open, revealing a windswept, snow-covered roof. Frigid wind
whips snow into your face.

>OUT
You enter the freezing, biting cold of the blizzard.

Skyscraper Roof
A low parapet surrounds a small roof here. The air conditioning cooling tower
and the small protrusion containing the stairs are dwarfed by a semitransparent
dome which towers above you. The blowing snow obscures all detail of the city
across the river to the south.

>U
Inside Dome
You are inside a large domed area. The dome contains equipment that makes it
clear it is a weather observation station. For some reason, it also contains a
small peach tree. Wind whistles outside, and snow blasts against the
semitransparent material of the dome.

Something smashes against the glass of the dome! You turn and see a dark shape
clinging to the outside of the structure.

>D
You enter the freezing, biting cold of the blizzard.

Skyscraper Roof

A dark shape watches balefully from nearby.

The dark shape moves. Above the howl of the wind you hear a high-pitched keening
noise.

the creature was made of air.

Small Courtyard
This courtyard is a triumph of modern architecture. It is spare, cold, angular,
overwhelming in size, and bears a striking resemblance to a wind tunnel whenever
the breeze picks up. Right now this is true of the whole campus, though. A huge
mass lurks nearby, and an almost featureless skyscraper is to the north.

Dead Storage, on the forklift
This is a storage room. It contains an incredible assemblage of discarded junk.
Some of it is so old and mouldering that you can't be sure where one bit of junk
stops and the next begins. It's piled to the ceiling on ancient, rotting
pallets; you can't even see the east wall.

>MOVE JUNK WITH LIFT
You have a little trouble using the forklift, but it's not really all that hard.
You start clearing junk, moving it around and trying to create a passage.

>G
You continue moving junk, becoming more proficient with the forklift.

You've built a fairly narrow (about one forklift wide) path through the junk.
You can see an opening into a further storage room beyond this one.

>E
Ancient Storage, on the forklift
What's deader than dead storage? That's what's in this room. Most of the
contents have collapsed or rusted back to the primordial ooze. There is mold
growing on some of the unidentifiable piles. Stagnant puddles of water pollute
the floor. You can now believe how old some of these foundations are said to be.

There is a closed, disused-looking manhole here.

>EXIT
Please use compass directions instead.

>EXIT LIFT
You are now on your feet.

>OPEN COVER WITH BAR
You lever the manhole cover aside, and crusted dirt falls into a dark, partly
obstructed hole below.

>D
You push your way through cobwebs, damp fungus, and other obstructions.

Brick Tunnel
This is an ancient tunnel constructed of roughly mortared bricks and stones. A
slippery and almost invisible set of handholds leads up. The tunnel continues a
long way north and south from here.

>N
You make your way along the long tunnel.

Renovated Cave
You are in a huge, cave-like construction. A path leads down to a floor partly
covered with rough concrete. The walls and ceiling are high and reinforced with
beams of wood, iron, and steel. In the center of the floor you can see a large,
flat slab of granite. The only exit is behind you to the south.

>D
Before the Altar
You are at the bottom of the cave. The huge slab of granite in the center is a
sort of altar. It is carved with strange and disturbing symbols, the largest of
which looks very familiar. Some of the symbols are obscured by rusty red stains.
Nearby is an iron plate set in the concrete of the floor.

Lying to one side of the altar stone is a sharp, thin-bladed knife.

Chemistry Building
This corridor is lined with closed, dark offices. At the south end of the
corridor is a door with a light shining behind it. There is something written on
the door.

>KNOCK ON DOOR
You knock on the door. The hollow sound reverberates down the hall. You sort of
wish you had knocked more softly.

>Z
Time passes...

The door opens partway, revealing a professorial man in a white lab coat. He
smiles. "Good evening! I don't get many visitors this late. You're not one of my
students, are you?" He ushers you into the room without waiting for an answer,
closing the door behind you.

Department of Alchemy
This office is clinically clean, shiny, and modern. It looks like something out
of a science fiction movie. A closed door to the north leads back into the
corridor and an archway opens to the south.

Taped to the wall to the right of the archway is a sign-up sheet.

The professor is here.

>GIVE PAPER TO HIM
He reads it carefully. "What drivel! This just confirms my suspicions. He had
clearly gone over the edge. Drug use, drinking, insanity. It's only too bad that
I didn't realize what was happening. I might have helped him."

The professor gazes at you with a distinctly predatory air.

>S
"Ah! You'd like to see the lab?" the professor asks in a rather unctuous tone.
"Come right in!" He ushers you through the archway into the lab, following
quickly behind you and turning on the lights.

Lab
The lab is an ultramodern, fully equipped chemistry lab. Unfortunately, or
perhaps fortunately, you aren't a chemistry major, so the equipment might as
well be magical.

The professor is here.

There is a lab bench and an Alchemy Department computer here. Sitting on the lab
bench is a vat. The vat contains a tarry liquid.

The professor guides you to the center of the lab, where a strange pentagonal
symbol is chalked on the floor. He cuts one of the chalk lines with a small
knife you had not previously noticed, pushes you into the center of the chalked
symbol, and redraws the line, muttering softly and rhythmically as he does so.
"There, that's done. Don't move from there, it'll only make things worse for
you." He makes some odd gestures at the archway and then goes over to the lab
bench.

>Z
Time passes...

The professor is preparing something at the lab bench. "Alchemy is my chosen
field, and I've gotten ridiculed for it. It's like chemistry, except that
chemists don't recognize that some natural laws are enforced by persons, not
physics. Some of them will grant power, or knowledge, but they must be placated,
or even bribed. They're not of this earth, not demons or devils, and they aren't
always friendly. To me it's just an unpleasant necessity on the path to power.
When I'm done, they won't laugh anymore!"

>Z
Time passes...

The professor enters another pentagram, and begins a highly choreographed
ritual. "This may seem a little silly to you, but the symbology is what's
important. Certain alignments, certain aspects. In a few moments, it won't
matter anyway," he remarks. "There is very little room for error here, so be
calm." He chants, he brandishes strange instruments, moves about inside the
pentagram, and occasionally points to you. It becomes clear exactly what he
meant by the word "bribe."

>CUT LINE WITH KNIFE
You cut the outer lines of the pentagram. It no longer completely encloses you.
The professor sees what you've done out of the corner of his eye. He stares,
horrified. "Stop, don't move!" he says between verses of the chant. The chant
takes on a pleading tone.

The chant grows more complex, the professor having difficulty with the almost
unpronounceable words, with rhythms and cadences that make you want to stop your
ears. The room appears to be getting darker.

>EXIT
You push your way through a soft spot just over the scuff marks, and are outside
the pentagram. The air is thick and close.

calls are being answered.

The lab is a shambles. It looks like something red and sticky has been spread

There is a brass hyrax, a piece of paper, a lab bench and an Alchemy Department
computer here. Sitting on the lab bench is a vat. The vat contains a tarry
liquid.

>PUT HAND IN VAT
When you dip the mummified hand in the liquid, the elixir begins to bubble
furiously. You can't really see the hand, except when a finger pokes up every so
often.

The hand bobs to the surface. It's odd, but it looked like one of the fingers
moved.

Inner Lair
The floor here is a stagnant, slime infested pool of water. It feels to be about
six inches deep. Ropes or wires tumble down the slope, where they enter a large
whitish mass which takes up much of the chamber. The noise is loud here, and
comes from the mass, which undulates in synchrony with the noise. Wan,
sourceless light illuminates the chamber.

Set on the wall, incongruous in its surroundings, is a metal box. On one side a
coaxial cable enters the box. On the other, a cablelike appendage leads from the
box to the mass. There is a metal cover on the box.

Suddenly, the hand leaps from your shoulder into the slime-encrusted puddle. It
dives beneath the water.

You root around blindly in the gooey, slimy water. You feel something thick and
slippery! A tentacle? No, it's cold and dead. It seems to be a line of some
kind, just below the surface.

You pull a length of the line out of the water. It's like holding a large, heavy

suspected you'd get this far!"

You strike the line with the axe, making a deep gash in the insulation.

The hacker stares at the thing in the cave. "I got very suspicious about your
problems with the net. I began to trace some coax, found some repeaters and
bridges that weren't on the layout charts, and started following them. Anyway,
here I am. That thing there, whatever it is, and those wires, are interfaced to
the whole campus net. And that means it's tied into all the nets, commercial,
government, even military, potentially."

>G
Your blow cuts through more insulation and into the conductors.

"I guess I better do something. It could be a serious compromise of system
integrity if this thing isn't dealt with." He peers at the mass, as if
evaluating it. He then reaches into a pocket and pulls out a small pair of wire
strippers.

>G
The line parts! The two ends begin to sink towards the water as they straighten
out.

The hacker advances on the mass, apparently planning to cut some of the wires
leading into it. As he approaches it, the sound stops completely, and the wires
begin a frantic, looping, twining dance. The mass begins to flow towards the
hacker almost as quickly as he walks toward it. They reach each other and begin
to merge together. He screams; a long, ululating cry that echoes through the
cavern. Then he is engulfed.

>GET IT
You carefully grab the line just as it's about to drop into the water.

The mass is bulging, vibrating, and rippling.

>OPEN COVER
You remove the cover, revealing a plethora of electronic innards. Most prominent
are a socket into which the coaxial cable is plugged, and a connector into which
the glistening cablelike appendage disappears.

The mass is bulging, vibrating, and rippling.

>GET COAX
You unscrew the cable. It now hangs unconnected inside the box.

The mass is bulging, vibrating, and rippling. A huge tear is forming near where
the hacker was absorbed.

You shove the exposed conductors into the socket, producing a shower of sparks!
The tentacle connected to the other socket begins to jerk and twitch
spasmodically. The mass it's connected to quivers, and a horrible noise, almost
like a huge machine running without oil, issues from the thing.

The mass begins to change shape, compacting, darkening. You can briefly see
human outlines within the grey, gelatinous mass. They surround something larger,
of a shape not human, not animal, like nothing you've seen before.

The gelatinous mass solidifies and compacts, leaving behind a litter of smoking
debris. In the debris squats a being. Huge, misshapen, it stares at you with
baleful yellow eyes. Its scaly wings beat slowly, driving a fetid stench through
the stale air of the cavern. A barbed tongue slides across its broken,
daggerlike fangs.

The smooth stone vibrates. It starts to feel warm.

>Z
Time passes...

The thing tenses, preparing to leap. Its mouth opens, revealing not the
glistening interior, but a dead-black outline like a hole into nothingness.

The smooth stone is now glowing with a bright-red heat that nevertheless fails
to burn you.

>THROW STONE AT CREATURE
The stone smashes into the creature, sticking to its ichorous hide. The thing
thrashes about, trying to bite at the stone, which is glowing brighter and
brighter. Small hands issue from beneath its scales to tug in vain at the
irritant. The creature begins to show gaping holes of dark, light-devouring
nothingness around the stone. Its wings spread painfully, as though it were
trying to fly away, and then fold. It widens its jaw in an almost human scream
of agony. The black hole of its maw overwhelms it, and indeed the creature
appears to be swallowing itself. At last, a grey cloud of greasy smoke surrounds
the glowing stone, still suspended in midair. Then even that vanishes, and the
stone drops to the ground, no longer glowing. The thing is gone.

You pick up the stone. It has a long jagged crack that almost breaks it in half.
As you pick it up, you feel it bump to one side. Then, as you are holding it in
your hand, something pushes its way out through the crack, breaking the stone
into two pieces. Something small, pale, and damp blinks its watery eyes at you.
It hisses, gaining strength, and spreads membranous wings.

It takes to the air, at first clumsily, then with increased assurance, and
disappears into the gloom. One eerie cry drifts back to where you stand.

Something rises out of the mud, slowly straightening. The hacker, mud-covered
and weak, staggers to his feet. "Can I have my key back?" he asks.
